It might be awkward, but please don't scroll past this. This Thursday we humbly ask you to defend Wikipedia's independence. 98% of our readers don't give; they simply look the other way. If you are an exceptional reader who has already donated, we sincerely thank you. If you donate just ₹ 150, Wikipedia could keep thriving for years. Most people donate for a simple reason—because Wikipedia is useful. If Wikipedia has given you ₹ 150 worth of knowledge this year, take a minute to donate. Show the volunteers who bring you reliable, neutral information that their work matters.
